<h1>Git Workflow: Feature Branches</h1>
<h3>Successful teams follow 3 easy rules to integrate git into their daily workflow:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Commit early and often.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don't break master.</strong> The code in <code>origin/master</code> always works. No errors, no UI glitches. No exceptions.</li>
<li><strong>Use feature branches.</strong> One branch per feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document describes a sample development workflow using a feature branch containing all the front-end tests for our project. This branch will be called frontend-tests, but no one has created it yet.</p>
<h2>Command Overview</h2>
<pre><code>➜ cd ~/dev/repos/r3view
➜ git pull origin master
➜ git checkout -b frontend-tests master
➜ git add .
➜ git commit -m &quot;added nightmarejs to package.json&quot;
➜ git pull origin master
➜ git push origin frontend-tests
</code></pre>
<h2>Step by Step</h2>
<p><code>[Note: run all commands that begin with ➜!]</code></p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>On your <strong>local</strong> machine, <code>cd</code> to the project directory. In git, this is known as your <strong>working directory</strong>, which was created when you executed git clone at the beginning of the project.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:~
➜ cd ~/dev/repos/r3view
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Update your <strong>local</strong> repository with the latest revision of <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on master [$!]
➜ git pull origin master

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Now that your <strong>local</strong> <code>master</code> branch is up-to-date with your team's latest changes, create a branch locally by <strong>running the exact command</strong> below. There are other ways to do this, but <strong>this one is foolproof</strong>. This syntax creates a new branch named <code>frontend-tests</code> based on an existing branch, <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on master [$!]
➜ git checkout -b frontend-tests master
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Code that feature!</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Stage and commit your changeset to your <strong>local</strong> branch. Write clear, consise commit messages. This information is invaluable to your coworkers, teammates, not to mention yourself – six months from now.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on frontend-tests [$+]
➜ git add .


dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on frontend-tests [$+]
➜ git commit -m &quot;added nightmarejs to package.json&quot;

[frontend-tests ebfe4a6] added nightmarejs to package.json
 8 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Integrate upstream changes from <code>origin/master</code>, which adds them to our <strong>local</strong> branch.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on frontend-tests [$+]
➜ git pull origin master

From ssh://github.com/droxey/r3view
 * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>Push your new branch, as well as your changeset, to <code>origin/frontend-tests</code>.</p>
<pre><code>dani@mbp:dev/repos/r3view on frontend-tests
➜ git push origin `frontend-tests`

[new branch]      `frontend-tests` -&gt; `frontend-tests`
</code></pre>
<p>This branch is now available on your <code>origin</code> – simply open up GitHub, GitLab, or Heroku to verify! When complete, ask your team lead to review your code and merge it to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h2>IMPORTANT!</h2>
<p><em>Repeat this process each time you finish a part of the feature or need to take a break. Feature branches are considered works in progress – so commit and push to your feature branches as much as possible; even if it's not done! If something goes terribly wrong, origin/frontend-tests serves as a history, backup, and record of your valuable work!</em></p>
